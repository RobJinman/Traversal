## Traversal

Traversal is a sociological experiment pertaining to the nature of belief. Generally, on any given issue, people will select the opinion that is most consistent with their identity and rationalise it afterwards. If they take particular interest in the subject they’ll read books to equip themselves with the various arguments in support of what they’ve pre-decided is true. For every ideology there will be some corner of the Internet that provides for them a safe haven, sheltered from opposing points of view. Conservatives will thus read conservative blogs, and liberals will read liberal blogs. Traversal aims to mix things up.

Authors construct articles intended to convey a single point. Rather than being laid out linearly, each article is arranged as a decision tree. Like Wikipedia, they are publicly editable, with restrictions. At each node the reader is presented with textual and graphical information, possibly a question, and a series of answers or common counterarguments. They select the option that most fits their opinion, whereupon they are transported to the next node. This is a useful format for presenting a persuasive case, as it allows an author to argue with their readers, forcing them to respond to what might have otherwise remained rhetorical questions.

Each tree functions as a sorting machine that sorts people according to their beliefs. If a tree has many leaves, then each leaf may come to represent quite a nuanced point of view. The trees are linked together such that when a reader exits a tree via a leaf, they are transported seamlessly to the root of the tree that is proven by clever statistical analysis to be the one most likely to change their opinion.

A widget will be provided to authors of blogs and news sites which they can add to the bottom of their articles. The widget will display questions or counterarguments written by the author (or simply ‘agree’/’disagree’ buttons). Upon embedding the widget, the article becomes the root of a new tree within the Traversal Public Graph. If the content proves persuasive, the algorithm will attach the article to a great number of leaves, directing a lot of traffic to the article. This is the opposite of preaching to the choir, as visitors who arrive via this route will be sceptical of the article’s content.

Traversal will offer an interesting browsing experience, presenting to the reader information that is the proven, crowd-sourced optimal case against their position.

In addition, the dataset that Traversal generates will be of sociological value.
